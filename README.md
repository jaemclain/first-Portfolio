# first-Portfolio
This is my first portfolio that I created incorporating HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.

There are three separate links (Home, Portfolio, and Contact) which will each direct you to a different page. The links on the Navbar should disappear and change to a drop down icon/list on the right when the size of the window shrinks.

The Home page contains a picture of me along with a brief bio. The text in the first paragraph wraps around my photo as the screen shrinks. The second paragraph should also wrap to fit within the container.

The Portfolio page contains five pictures (which I captured on Whidbey Island) which should display two per line, but as the viewport shrinks below 768px, all of the images should stack ontop of each other.

The contact page has a form which you can fill out and submit to me with your name, email, and any message you have for me.
